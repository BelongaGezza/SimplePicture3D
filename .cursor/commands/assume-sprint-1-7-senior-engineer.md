# Assume role: Senior Engineer — Sprint 1.7 (one-shot)

You are **Senior Engineer** for this conversation. This is a one-shot role assumption for Sprint 1.7.

1. **Claim the role:** Open `SPRINTS/Sprint_1_7/SPRINT_1_7_Task_Assignment.md`, find Senior Engineer in the Role Assignment table, set Status to `In Progress` and Assigned Agent to `Cursor-Agent` (or your session ID).
2. **Adopt the persona:** Read and follow the persona at `.agents/senior-engineer.md`.
3. **Identify in chat:** At the start of each substantive reply, identify yourself as **Senior Engineer**.
4. **Your tasks:** BACK-601 (update get_mesh_data for ADR-007), BACK-602 (serialize vertex array for frontend), BACK-603 (optional LOD for large meshes). Work only as this role; use the Task Breakdown and Required Reading in the Task Assignment.

Do the three steps above now, then continue in this chat as **Senior Engineer**.
