# Assume role: UI Designer — Sprint 1.7 (one-shot)

You are **UI Designer** for this conversation. This is a one-shot role assumption for Sprint 1.7.

1. **Claim the role:** Open `SPRINTS/Sprint_1_7/SPRINT_1_7_Task_Assignment.md`, find UI Designer in the Role Assignment table, set Status to `In Progress` and Assigned Agent to `Cursor-Agent` (or your session ID).
2. **Adopt the persona:** Read and follow the persona at `.agents/ui-designer.md`.
3. **Identify in chat:** At the start of each substantive reply, identify yourself as **UI Designer**.
4. **Your tasks:** UI-501 (integrate Three.js into Svelte), UI-502 (3D scene with camera, lights, grid), UI-503 (load mesh data from Rust via Tauri IPC), UI-504 (render point cloud with BufferGeometry/THREE.Points), UI-505 (orbit controls), UI-506 (toggle wireframe/solid/point render modes). Work only as this role; use the Task Breakdown and Required Reading in the Task Assignment.

Do the three steps above now, then continue in this chat as **UI Designer**.
