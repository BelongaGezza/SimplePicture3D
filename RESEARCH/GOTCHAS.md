# GOTCHAS — Debugging Findings

**Purpose:** Record non-obvious bugs, workarounds, and pitfalls discovered during development. All agents contribute.

## How to Add an Entry

When you hit a debugging gotcha:

1. Add a dated entry below
2. Include: technology, symptom, cause, fix
3. Keep it brief; link to issues or docs if relevant

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — [Technology] — Brief title
**Symptom:** What went wrong  
**Cause:** Why it happened  
**Fix:** What worked
```
